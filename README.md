# Objective  
The objective of this task was to understand and implement tree-based machine learning models for classification and regression using the Heart Disease dataset.

# Tools Used  
* Scikit-learn  
* Graphviz  
* Matplotlib and seaborn 

# What We Did  
* Loaded and explored the Heart Disease dataset.  
* Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized the model using Graphviz with custom green-colored nodes.  
* Controlled overfitting by training a Decision Tree with limited depth.  
* Trained a Random Forest Classifier and compared its accuracy to the Decision Tree.  
* Visualized feature importances from the Random Forest using green-colored bar plots.  
* Evaluated the model using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent performance.

# Output  

* `decision_tree_green.png` was generated showing the decision tree with green-themed visualization.  
*  Feature Importance plot was displayed using green bars.
